# set

A Set is an unordered collection data type that is iterable, mutable and has no duplicate elements. 
Pythonâ€™s set class represents the mathematical notion of a set. The major advantage of using a set, 
as opposed to a list, is that it has a highly optimized method for checking whether a specific element is contained in the set. 
This is based on a data structure known as a hash table. Since sets are unordered, we cannot access items using indexes like we do in lists.
